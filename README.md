# StackOverflow2020AnnualSurvey

## Libraries and Language used:<br>
This Jupyter notebook is written in Python, using libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn<br>

## Motivation behind this project<br>
Personally I didn't start coding early and I felt really left behind when I first started univeristy. A lot of my peers at the university have lots of coding experience before they come while I have none. Therefore, all the relations investigated in this notebook is to examine if coding experience have a relation with pay. In this notebook, three questiosns are asked. <br>

## Files introduction<br>
1. survey_results_public.csv - CSV file with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer<br>
2. survey_results_schema.csv - CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name<br>
3. so_survey_2020.pdf - PDF file of survey instrument<br>
4. The jupyter notebook is for analysis and writing code.
The survey was fielded from February 5 to February 28, 2020. The median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was 16.6 minutes.
  
  
## Some conclusions drawn from the project:<br>
1, There are no obvious relationship between person's first coding age and their salary now. However, from the scatter plot, we can see that people who start coding after 30 will have a lower income generally.<br>
2, People can be a professional developer even if they do not start early.<br>
3, More coding experience does not necessarily mean more salary.<br>
One more conclusion(not for the purpose of these three questions):<br>
Most people are paid less than 1.00 and there are some people who are paid at around 2.00. Less people are paid in the range between 1.00 to 2.00. Hence, only few people can achive really high salary and there is not much "middle" salary.
